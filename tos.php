AY may, in its sole discretion and without notice, start, stop or modify any regulation or enforcement measures at any time. AY action or inaction to regulate content or conduct or to enforce against any potential violation of the TOU by any user (or any other third party) does not waive AY's right to implement or not implement regulation or enforcement measures with respect to any subsequent or similar content, conduct or potential TOU violation.

Accordingly, you further agree that any representation (written or verbal) by any AY Representative (or by anyone else acting on behalf of AY or by anyone purportedly acting on behalf of AY) that AY (including but not limited to any AY Representative, anyone else acting on behalf of AY, or anyone purportedly acting on behalf of AY) would or would not prevent, restrict, redress or regulate content (including, without limitation, screen, block, moderate, review, remove, terminate, delete, edit or otherwise stop, cure or exclude any content), or to implement other enforcement measures against any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation is superseded by this provision and is nonbinding and unenforceable. Specifically, you agree that AY, AY Representatives and anyone else authorized to act on behalf of AY shall in no circumstance be liable as a result of any representation that AY, a AY Representative or anyone else on behalf of AY would or would not restrict or redress any content, conduct or potential or purported TOU violation. This paragraph may not be modified, waived or released except by a written agreement, dated and signed by AY's Chief Executive Officer and dated and signed by the individual or entity to whom the modification, waiver or release is granted.
