	        <h2>Searching</h2>
	        <span class='medium'><p>Once you find a lesson you are interested in, you can 'request' that lesson, which will let the professor know you're interested. It will also allow the professor to contact you through email</p></span>
	       	</br>
	       	<h2>Waiting</h2>
	       	<span class='medium'><p>Sometimes the instructor wont be able to contact you instantly, so don't be worried if you have to wait a day or two</p></span>
	       	</br>
	       	<h2>Finally</h2>
	       	<span class='medium'><p>When you've been contacted by the instructor you requested, they will fill you in on important information. Including; times to meet, lesson details.</p></span>

	       	<h2>Courtesy</h2>
			<span class='medium'><p>Being kind and courteous to your instructor, or student, is directly proportional to the effort given by the other party. And more effort=more knowledge</p></span>
